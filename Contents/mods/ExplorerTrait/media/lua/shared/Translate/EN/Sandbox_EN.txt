Data is saved on each individual square so you don't have to worry about your progress or grind, you will get the trait if you play game normally and explore the world.<br>This option has no impact on performance.<br>HOWEVER! Mod stores data about last 6 (by default, can be adjusted in Cells memory) visited cells. And those 6 visited cells each can hold up to 45k values if you set required % exploration to max (50% of 90k). ModData crashes somewhere around 90k values, so set up this value accordingly. Cells memory * 90k * whatever percentage you set up here MUST be around 90k to make sure modData never crashes. So for example, if you set % here to 20, and Cells memory to 7 then 7 * 90k * 0.2 = 126k should be fine-ish. There's failsafe in the code that will purge oldest visited unexplored cell if values goes above 90k so don't be afraid that wrong setting will crash your game. However, it can definitely make harder for you to get the trait if you set your Cells memory or % required too high, because you'll have to commit to 1 cell more, since older cells will be forgotten if your total explored tiles go over 90k. I left debug prints uncommented in code on purpose, you can find them in console.txt by searching for 'DET:', recommend using Notepad+ or similar advanced tool for text files.",
